The recitation of ordinary Muslims differs from professional recordings in many ways: for example, it may include background noise, or may be recited by people with limited knowledge of tajweed, or the demographics of reciters may be different. By collecting this data, we can train machine learning models, which we will release to software-developers who are interested in developing a wide variety of applications that are based on recitation2text, things like:",
